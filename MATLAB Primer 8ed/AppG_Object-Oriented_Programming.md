## G.1 Classes and Objects

* **class** determines the class of a variable. See p. 184.  
* **classdef** is a statement that defines a class, with properties and methods. The class definition is terminated by an end statement. [p. 57]  
* **exist** determines if a class or object exists. See p. 166.  
* **methods** is both a function and a keyword. The function  
* **methods(A)** lists the public methods of a class or object A. As a keyword, the methods statement defines the set of methods for a class, terminated by an end statement. [p. 59]  
* **properties** is both a function and a keyword. The function properties(A) lists the public properties of a class or object A. As a keyword, the properties statement defines the set of properties for a class, terminated by an end statement. [p. 58]  
* **subsref** is the method for subscripted references to objects.  

## G.2 Handle Classes

* **delete** deletes a handle object.  
* **findobj** finds a graphics object with specific properties.  
* **get** returns the properties of an object. See p. 205.  
* **handle** is the superclass for all handle classes, including Handle Graphics. [p. 66]  
* **set** lists or sets the properties of an object. set(H) lists the properties that can be modified via set(H,’Property’,value) . See p. 205.
