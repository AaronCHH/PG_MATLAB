# A Appendix: The MATLAB Top 500

* Open the online Help window, select Help:MATLAB ◮Functions and Help:Symbolic Math Toolbox ◮Functions, and you will see a lengthy index of all functions in MATLAB and the Symbolic Math Toolbox.  
* Many of these functions are needed only in special cases, however, or for very specific kinds of applications.  
* This Appendix gives you a more manageable index, with a description of the 500 most frequently used functions, operators, and special characters in MATLAB and the Symbolic Math Toolbox, in the same outline as the Help ◮Functions documentation.  
* In this Appendix, a page reference in brackets refers to a discussion of the function in the main part of the book.  
* Other page references refer to this Appendix.
